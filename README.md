# SensiMate

In this project, we, 5 students at DTU (the Technical University of Denmark).

We have been given the task to create an app called SensiMate.
The app is made in jetpack compose (for android only) folliwing the obligatory course "62550 User experience and mobile application development".

Sensimate is an app that allows you to be an admin, employee or an ordinary user.
An admin can create an employee, where they can both create an event with a set time and place, with some questions that form a survey.
Each user has their own data, which tells about them as a person taking the survey.
The surveys are about different food products and drinks, so that companies can get personal feedback from desired target groups before releasing a product.

Here is a poster of how it would look like on the Google Play Store:
